## How to run
python3 normalizer.py input_file output_file

Apologies but I misread the note about reading from stdin, writing to stdout, and printing to stderr. I parse the input and output files as arguments, and print error messages to console. If I had more time after realizing this, I would have corrected it.

## Assumptions made:
1. Other than Notes, all other columns are non-empty
2. Column Headers are kept in consistent order and do not need to be normalized or have non-unicode characters.
3.
